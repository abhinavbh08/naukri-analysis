# naukri-analysis
This is a personal project done out of curiosity for the data science jobs in India. It contains all the steps starting from data extraction, data cleaning, data loading and data analysis. I was just curious about what is the average experience for the data scientist roles along with the most in-demand skills. So, I just scraped the data from a website and started performing analysis. The descripton of this project is also done at my blog.
